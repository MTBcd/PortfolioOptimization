# Portfolio Optimization

## Overview
This project contains a comprehensive set of portfolio optimization strategies and tools implemented in Python. It is designed for financial analysts and data scientists to explore various methods of portfolio allocation, risk management, and performance analysis.

## Features
- **Mean Variance Optimization**: Implements Markowitz's theory for portfolio optimization.
- **Risk Parity**: Allocates assets to achieve equal risk contributions.
- **Maximum Sharpe Ratio**: Optimizes the portfolio to maximize the Sharpe ratio.
- **Hierarchical Risk Parity (HRP)**: Clustering-based portfolio allocation technique.
- **Inverse Volatility Allocation**: Allocates assets inversely proportional to their volatility.
- **Maximum Diversification**: Optimizes for diversification to reduce portfolio risk.
- **Minimum Value at Risk (VaR)**: Allocates to minimize portfolio's VaR.
- **Minimum Variance**: Allocates assets to get as low as possible the total variance of the portfolio.
- **Risk Budgeting**: Implement a volatility budgets for each asset to find the allocations that match those budgets.
- **Bond Analysis Tools**: Includes Macaulay and Modified Duration, and Convexity calculations for fixed-income securities.
